# Notes
	- Can large samples lead to misleading results?
	- ## p-values approach 0 when the sample size grows
		- The null hypothesis is never totally true for a two sides hypothesis. The two values aren't equal to infinite decimal places.
		- The math forces the p-va
	- ((6463dba8-ca3d-428c-9513-f5731706b8da))
		- Use different sample sizes to show different values of significance.

	- ((6463e17b-57f6-47ab-a5d5-0c0e88f4bc1f)) p value decreases logarithmically - connects to the logarithmic increase with more training data mentioned in [[Unbiased Look at Dataset Bias]]
