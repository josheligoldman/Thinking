- # Notes
	- I think the paper is arguing that the theory-driven algorithms were developed with certain implicit assumptions about the camera settings. Therefore, when tested on data outside those ranges, they perform poorly. Data-driven models, on the other hand, can adapt to different setting as long as those settings are represented in their datasets. Therefore, it is unfair to test data-driven and theory driven on the same test sets, since the theory driven models weren't designed for that data.

	- Context
		- Answering the question why data-driven machine learning performs so much better than theory driven machine learning
	- Contributions
		- Argues that theory-driven models were developed for specific camera settings, so they don't adapt well to settings outside their range. Therefore, it is unfair to compare them to data-drive approaches on test sets outside their specified range. Perhaps, the gap between data-driven and theory-driven models would be smaller if they were tested more fairly.
