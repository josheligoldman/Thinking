- # Notes
	- I think the paper is arguing that the theory-driven algorithms were developed with certain implicit assumptions about the camera settings. Therefore, when tested on data outside those ranges, they perform poorly. Data-driven models, on the other hand, can adapt to different setting as long as those settings are represented in their datasets. Therefore, it is unfair to test data
