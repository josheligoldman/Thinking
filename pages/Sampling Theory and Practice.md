		- Populations
			- Target population - all units
			- Frame population - units covered by frame
			- Sampled population - set of units that have a non-zero chance of being sampled.
		- Stratification + clustering
			- Population is split up into groups
			- In stratified random sampling, every strata is sampled from
			- Under clustering, only a portion of the clusters are sampled from.
		- Probability sampling
			- Each subset is assigned a probability of being selected.
			- Practically, we draw samples one at a time instead of assigning each sample a probability
