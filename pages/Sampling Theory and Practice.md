		- Populations
			- Target population - all units
			- Frame population - units covered by frame
			- Sampled population - set of units that have a non-zero chance of being sampled.
		- Stratification + clustering
			- Population is split up into groups
			- In stratified random sampling, every strata is sampled from
			- Under clustering, only a portion of the clusters are sampled from.
		- Probability sampling
			- Each subset is assigned a probability of being selected.
			- Practically, we draw samples one at a time instead of assigning each sample a probability

		- ((64650641-256c-435e-ae98-90d6c46c682d)) Simple random sampling without replacement
		- Sampling Strategy
			- sampling designs
			- statistical analysis
			- Both these pieces have to go hand in hand
		- ((64650887-6dfd-4d92-98c7-2dbb6a07db0e))
			- Select one unit from the first $1, 2, \dots, K$. Then, your sample will be the units $x, x+k, x+2k, \dots, x + (n-1)k$
			- Variance estimator is biased

			- Read the references below this for papers on central limit theorems for various survey designs.
		- Sample size for SRSWR
			- Absolute Error:

			- Relative Error:
				- ((64650cc3-de20-469f-bfdb-bf9f71e16c5a))
			- How to estimate variance before study?
				- Historical data
				- Small initial survey
		- Inverse sampling for rare items
			- Fix $m$. Sample until you get $m$ instances of the rare item. Suppose you sample $n$ items total. Then, $\frac{m-1}{n-1}$ is an unbiased estimator of $M/N$

		- Stratified sampling
			- When using stratified sampling, the typical population mean and variance aren't useful statistics
			- The correct formula involves weighting each stratas mean/variances.

			- ((646510e8-58a9-4895-8445-74167fe88251)) Paper discusses theoretical results for stratified sampling
			- Stratification provides ((64651148-c043-4660-97a3-5ea5d1e9feaf))
			- TO READ: Read about spatially balanced probabilistic sampling
		- Sample size allocation under stratified sampling
			- Proportional allocation ((64651229-0146-415f-aea3-961ddce5a9f3))
			- Proportional allocation is more accurate than SRSWOR for estimating population parameters.
				- ((646512da-8b3c-48ce-9933-6308554fa665))
				- Gains are greatest when units within a strata are all very similar, and the strata are all very distinct from one another
