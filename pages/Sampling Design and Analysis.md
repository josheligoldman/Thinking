		- Terms:
			- Observational Unit - object on which the measurement is taken
			- Target Population - Complete collection of observations we want to study
			- Sample - A subset of the population
			- Sampled Population - The set of all units that might have been chosen for the sample
			- Sampling Unit - Unit that is selected for the sample. For example, we might select households when studying people since that is what we have access to.
			- Sampling Frame - Specification of samplings units from which the sample may be selected.
		- Selection Bias
			- Certain groups are sampled at a different rate than other groups.
			- Convenience samples:
				- Units are chosen based on convenience. Often the first units they see.
			- Judgement Samples
				- The sampler chooses a representative sample based on their judgement.
			- Self-selected
				- Volunteers are sampled
			- Undercoverage
				- Sampling frame doesn't include same parts of the target population
			- Overcoverage
				- Units not in the target population end up in the sample
				- Also includes duplicated being included in the sample.
					- For example, households may have multiple numbers
			- Nonresponse
